**Titanic #6**
In my previous attempt a year ago in Titanic #5, I did a pretty bad score, around 50%. I was just learning Python and applying a regression algorithm to a classification problem, duuuh

This year, I changed the pipeline approach and got a pretty good accuracy of 86% on my train set, which dropped to 77% on the Kaggle test set, so still bad. I kinda know why, I took some shortcut in the data pre-processing. Now I have the gist of it, it's time to move on to the next competition.
